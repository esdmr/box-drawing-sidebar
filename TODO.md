# To do

- Improve accessibility.
- Provide a canvas-based editor.
- Provide a command-based solution.
- Provide mixed light/heavy characters via search.
- Provide search bar.
- Support general ASCII arts.
- Provide a way to send a parameter from the extension to webview, specially to
  avoid the initial first flash.
- `resources/box-drawing.js`:

  ```js
  // FIXME: There might be a better way to do this (possibly in the
  // extension)?
  ```
