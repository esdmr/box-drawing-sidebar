# To do

- Improve accessibility.
- Provide a canvas-based editor.
- Provide a command-based solution.
- Provide mixed light/heavy characters via search.
- Provide search bar.
- Support general ASCII arts.
- Provide a way to send a parameter from the extension to webview, specially to
  avoid the initial first flash.
- Pass `workbench.reduceMotion` as a parameter to webviews.
- `resources/box-drawing.js`: There might be a better way to do this (possibly
  in the extension)?
